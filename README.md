Pisot sequences are a family of recursive sequences involving floors,
introduced by Charles Pisot in 1938. This repository contains Python code to
work with Pisot sequences and determine whether or not they satisfy linear
recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Most of the code is a
translation of Doron Zeilberger's Maple package
[Pisot.txt](http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/Pisot.txt), based
on [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05570) by Zeilberger and Neil
Sloane.

It is my hope that this Python implementation provides a more accessible
example of the uses of symbollic computation in languages more general than
Maple.
